.Multiple comparisons mean surprisingly little if the signal is strong and the dist is Gaussian. (and if you add together enough things, the dist is always Gaussian)
.4x of Gelman's 16x is from half the signal in a two-way being handled by a one-way; and a further 2x is from two-ways (in a binary setup) having less signal than one-ways.
.So there is no Theory to be had here, I just need more Practice.

.stdev is big! No wonder pode was always tiny. Ergo, dist around model mostly visible before model built.

.If I sim'd a dataset and had a program assign a value to every single 5-way interaction (and every 4-way, and etc etc etc) that would be cool but fucked up.
.When I go around analysing individual dsets I should see not just what the optimal treedepth is, but what the optimal treedepth would be with only k times the data for varying values of k (and how that changes with Drift, and how that changes with any other moderating factor).
